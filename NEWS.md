# ICIKendallTau 0.0.2

* Fixed an issue where a warning would be issued if {furrr} was not installed.

# ICIKendallTau 0.0.1

* First release. It's been tested and used rather thoroughly by myself, but I'd say it's still rather alpha. Even though I use it all the time myself.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
